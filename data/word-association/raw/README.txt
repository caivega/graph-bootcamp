"The purpose of this WEB site is to make the largest database of free association ever collected in the
United States available to interested researchers and scholars. More than 6,000 participants produced nearly
three-quarters of a million responses to 5,019 stimulus words. Participants were asked to write the first
word that came to mind that was meaningfully related or strongly associated to the presented word on the
blank shown next to each item. For example, if given BOOK _________, they might write READ on the blank
next to it. This procedure is called a discrete association task because each participant is asked to produce
only a single associate to each word."
