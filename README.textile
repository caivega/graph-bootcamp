Graph bootcamp is a lab-based graph systems workshop that teaches students how to model domains as graphs and solve domain-specific problems using graph traversals.
All developers can gain value from attending, especially if theyâ€™ve been solving data modeling exclusively through relational databases.
This workshop is all about heads-down development: light on one-to-many lecturing and heavy on coding and solution discovery.
Students will use an open source graph stack to solve real-world problems over provided data sets (discussed below).
Students will leave the bootcamp with code and inspiration pushing them to solve graph-related problems in their organization.
